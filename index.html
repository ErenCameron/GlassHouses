            <h1>The current state of our home is untenable.</h1>
    
            <p>By 2030, the temperature of the Earth will rise ~1.5Â°C. Oceans will rise, crops will die, and people will suffer. The economic systems that have led to massive inequality are built upon infrastructures that rely on carbon. While the economy widens the gap between rich and poor, the emissions that power it narrow the space between life and death. To have any chance of of building a better world, the one that exists must break. Our situation requires a complete overhaul of current energy infrastructure. Our entire economy must become carbon neutral immediately in order to attempt to avoid disaster. In the United States, growing support for a political action known as "The Green New Deal" must become a reality. It seeks to transition American to carbon-neutrality by 2050 by investing in renewable energy and a "smart" energy grid.</p>
            
            <p>Political action will not be enough.</p>
            <p>Politicians serve power, not people.</p>
            <p>We must show them the power of the people.</p>
